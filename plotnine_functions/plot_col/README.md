Need to check some of the functionality. I remember there is some issue with some of the arguments for the function that cause a couple of to not work as expected when used together. I think it is mainly stylistic issues. 

Need to add pics of example plots.

Here is a basic example:
![Example 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf64a6c4-c1dc-4b2f-a86b-bfd4df70cfe5)

The fill color and text labels are optional.
![Example 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5df328f8-4f89-4798-9327-b57f209ea36f)

Change formattiing to percent using the pcercent arg. 
![Example 3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c36205df-d200-457e-8fbc-24f86261e047)

Add faceting using the facet arg, only facet_wrap is currently supported.
![Example 4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31b6c85a-edd0-4159-9cf7-141ceecb5aef)

Can also specify several other facet args, granted in this example it is a bit messy.
