Tried several ways to make the five number summary.
My main issue with using describe() for this is that it returns a multi-indexed df that is very hard to work with.

A flexible cumulative sum function. It has optional groupby and sort args.

A flexible aggregate summary function. Can handle multiple group by vars.

A bit more powerful crosstab fuction (eg tabyl_two_vars).
